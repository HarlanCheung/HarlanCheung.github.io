<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello! I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, passionately delving into the world of biomedical engineering. My academic journey has led me to the Shaolab at the School of Biomedical Engineering, where I'm deeply engaged in cutting-edge research.

My research interests are centered around super-resolution imaging, image processing, and deep learning. These areas fascinate me as they combine the intricacies of engineering with the boundless possibilities of technology, leading to innovative solutions in the biomedical field.

I hold a Bachelor's degree from the Zhiyuan College of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My time there laid a solid foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, which I now apply to my research.

I am open to various forms of academic collaboration and am always eager to discuss new ideas and perspectives in my field. If you're interested in collaborating or would like to learn more about my work, feel free to contact me.

If my research areas align with your interests or if you're looking for collaboration opportunities, I'd love to hear from you. Let's explore the possibilities that lie at the intersection of engineering and biomedicine!

<!--My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).-->
